## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install it

    ```sh
    cd ac-static/
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*

    Open the `ac-static` directory in your code editor of choice and edit files in `src/`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
